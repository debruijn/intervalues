# Next steps
- Implement unit test for Counter
- Decouple Counter from shared Abstract Class
- Implement Set
- Implement List
- Implement Integer/Discrete option
- Tests for the above


# Future ideas
 - Sampling from this -> draw()
 - Weights for intervals? Could be attribute of "single_interval"
 - Complex intervals (so 2D; or why not higher?)
 - Moving/transforming individual or combined intervals

# Future tasks
 - Decide: gitlab / github incl CICD
 - What is needed to publish on pypi?
 - License choice
 - Create tests and use cases

# Future examples:
 - Showing number of planes present on airplane based on landing and departure times
 - Showing an integer counting problem where the number gets too big but with integer range it is doable
 - All people born under certain systems? Total payout of government support?
